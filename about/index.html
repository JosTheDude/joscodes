                        Hey! I'm Jos, I'm a Canadian (yes, I like playing hockey üèí)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm 17 and live, precisely, in Toronto, Canada. I have a lot of passions, mainly being a gamer or developer (sometimes they're the same :D). I like making friends and it's passion of mine to help out people around me! I was adopted into 
                        Canada by my parents and have lived here for 6 years. I have also lived in the US, England, and India too in foster care.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm constantly learning, and take every opportunity to learn and expand on things that I work on. I usually push the limits of what is asked of me, and that helps me learn and in turn adds more to the project I am working on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm really hyper, and quite energetic. Sometimes it's a good thing, and sometimes a bad thing. Personally though, I like to acknowledge my faults and utilize my hyperness to fix those faults, or just improve on my strengths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I‚Äôm a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By utilizing said energy and hyperness, I can channel it into dedication to what I do. Projects I work on, even if I'm juggling many at once, equally get attention and my full effort as I pursue them. I push the limits of not only my own ability, but how I can make the experience for those whom are going to use what I make. This drive makes me not only better as a developer, but also as a person to work with and be around.
                    </p>
